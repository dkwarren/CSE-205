Assignment 7 is a Java applet that when clicked on the 
  color buttons and dragging over the white panel, it
  draws lines of said color. Erase removes all line
  and undo erases the last line or undoes the last
  erase. WholePanel.java is the class holding all the
  information about the buttons and canvas panel. 
  Line.java holds information about the lines being drawn.
